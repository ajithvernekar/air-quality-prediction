# air-quality-prediction
This repository contains a regression model for air quality prediction using a multiple linear regression algorithm in R. The model is built using the air quality dataset, which includes hourly responses from a gas multisensor device deployed in an Italian city. The dataset also includes gas concentrations references from a certified analyzer.
